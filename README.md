# pyMongo2BigQuery
Module to help seamless query data from MongoDb and push it to a BigQuery dataset

pip install pyMongo2BigQuery will not work - waiting to remove all pylint warnings


Currently just clone the repository and do a pip install -requirements.txt in the project you intend to use. Copy the folder pyMongo2BigQuery and you can import

from pyMongo2BigQuery import mongoConnection
from pyMongo2BigQuery import bigQuery
